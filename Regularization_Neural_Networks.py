'''Regularization
Welcome to the second assignment of this week. Deep Learning models have so much flexibility and capacity that overfitting can be a serious problem, if the training dataset is not big enough. Sure it does well on the training set, but the learned network doesn't generalize to new examples that it has never seen!

You will learn to: Use regularization in your deep learning models.

Let's first import the packages you are going to use.

'''Non-regularized model
You will use the following neural network (already implemented for you below). This model can be used:

in regularization mode -- by setting the lambd input to a non-zero value. We use "lambd" instead of "lambda" because "lambda" is a reserved keyword in Python.
in dropout mode -- by setting the keep_prob to a value less than one
You will first try the model without any regularization. Then, you will implement:

L2 regularization -- functions: "compute_cost_with_regularization()" and "backward_propagation_with_regularization()"
Dropout -- functions: "forward_propagation_with_dropout()" and "backward_propagation_with_dropout()"
In each part, you will run this model with the correct inputs so that it calls the functions you've implemented. Take a look at the code below to familiarize yourself with the model.

'''Dropout
Finally, dropout is a widely used regularization technique that is specific to deep learning. It randomly shuts down some neurons in each iteration. Watch these two videos to see what this means!


When you shut some neurons down, you actually modify your model. The idea behind drop-out is that at each iteration, you train a different model that uses only a subset of your neurons. With dropout, your neurons thus become less sensitive to the activation of one other specific neuron, because that other neuron might be shut down at any time.

3.1 - Forward propagation with dropout
Exercise: Implement the forward propagation with dropout. You are using a 3 layer neural network, and will add dropout to the first and second hidden layers. We will not apply dropout to the input layer or output layer.

Instructions: You would like to shut down some neurons in the first and second layers. To do that, you are going to carry out 4 Steps:

In lecture, we dicussed creating a variable $d^{[1]}$ with the same shape as $a^{[1]}$ using np.random.rand() to randomly get numbers between 0 and 1. Here, you will use a vectorized implementation, so create a random matrix $D^{[1]} = [d^{[1](1)} d^{[1](2)} ... d^{[1](m)}] $ of the same dimension as $A^{[1]}$.
Set each entry of $D^{[1]}$ to be 0 with probability (1-keep_prob) or 1 with probability (keep_prob), by thresholding values in $D^{[1]}$ appropriately. Hint: to set all the entries of a matrix X to 0 (if entry is less than 0.5) or 1 (if entry is more than 0.5) you would do: X = (X < 0.5). Note that 0 and 1 are respectively equivalent to False and True.
Set $A^{[1]}$ to $A^{[1]} * D^{[1]}$. (You are shutting down some neurons). You can think of $D^{[1]}$ as a mask, so that when it is multiplied with another matrix, it shuts down some of the values.
Divide $A^{[1]}$ by keep_prob. By doing this you are assuring that the result of the cost will still have the same expected value as without drop-out. (This technique is also called inverted dropout.)

'''Backward propagation with dropout
Exercise: Implement the backward propagation with dropout. As before, you are training a 3 layer network. Add dropout to the first and second hidden layers, using the masks $D^{[1]}$ and $D^{[2]}$ stored in the cache.

Instruction: Backpropagation with dropout is actually quite easy. You will have to carry out 2 Steps:

You had previously shut down some neurons during forward propagation, by applying a mask $D^{[1]}$ to A1. In backpropagation, you will have to shut down the same neurons, by reapplying the same mask $D^{[1]}$ to dA1.
During forward propagation, you had divided A1 by keep_prob. In backpropagation, you'll therefore have to divide dA1 by keep_prob again (the calculus interpretation is that if $A^{[1]}$ is scaled by keep_prob, then its derivative $dA^{[1]}$ is also scaled by the same keep_prob).
